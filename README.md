# Test Project

This folder contains a small static web project used for testing and demonstration.

## Contents

- `index.html` - Main HTML page for the demo.
- `script.js` - JavaScript used by the demo.
- `style.css` - Styles for the demo.

## Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser to open the demo. Optionally, for a better local development experience, you can use the Live Server extension in VS Code (recommended) — it serves files over a local dev server and reloads on changes.

## How to run (quick options)

Open the project in your browser directly or use one of these local server options.

1) Open directly (no server)

 - Double-click `index.html` or open it from your browser (`File → Open File...`).

 Note: Some features (like fetch/XHR requests) may be restricted when using the file:// protocol.

2) Using Live Server (VS Code)

 - Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.
 - Open the `test` folder in VS Code.
 - Right-click `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server".

3) Using Live Server (VS Code) — recommended for development

 - Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.
 - Open the `test` folder in VS Code.
 - Right-click `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server".

Note: If you prefer a command-line server later, I can add a small PowerShell script or npm script — tell me which and I'll add it.

## File structure

 - `index.html` — entry page. Edit this to change content.
 - `style.css` — styles. Update or replace to change appearance.
 - `script.js` — client-side JavaScript.

## Customization

- Replace placeholder text in `index.html` with your own.
- Modify `style.css` to update colors, spacing, and layout.
- Edit `script.js` to add interactivity or integrate with APIs.

## Troubleshooting

- If styles or scripts don't load when opening the file directly, run a local server as described above.
- If the page is blank, check the browser console (F12) for errors.

## Contribution

This is a small demo; contributions are welcome:

- Fork the repo, make changes in the `test` folder, and open a pull request.
- Keep changes small and focused. Explain the change in the PR description.

## License

See the repository root `LICENSE` for license details.

If you'd like, I can also add a tiny README badge, example screenshot, or a live-preview GitHub Pages workflow. Tell me which and I'll add it.
